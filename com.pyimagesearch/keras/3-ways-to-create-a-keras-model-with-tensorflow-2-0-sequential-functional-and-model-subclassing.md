# 3 ways to create a Keras model with TensorFlow 2.0 (Sequential, Functional, and Model Subclassing)

![img-01]

Keras and TensorFlow 2.0 provide you with three methods to implement your own neural network architectures:

1. Sequential API
2. Functional API
3. Model subclassing

Inside of this tutorial you’ll learn how to utilize each of these methods, including how to choose the right API for the job.

## 3 ways to create a Keras model with TensorFlow 2.0 (Sequential, Functional, and Model subclassing)

In the first half of this tutorial, you will learn how to implement sequential, functional, and model subclassing architectures using Keras and TensorFlow 2.0. I’ll then show you how to train each of these model architectures.

Once our training script is implemented we’ll then train each of the sequential, functional, and subclassing models, and review the results.

Furthermore, all code examples covered here will be compatible with Keras and TensorFlow 2.0.
