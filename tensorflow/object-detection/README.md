# TensorFlowObjectDetectionTutorial [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/badge/?version=latest)](http://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
 

This is a "short" (rather lengthy) tutorial that started off as self notes on how to set-up and get going with the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

To read the actual tutorial, you have the following 2 (more like 3) options:
1. Visit [http://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io](http://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io). (By far the easiest)
2. Clone/Download the repo:
   - Open the "index.html" files under docs/build/ (Not guaranteed to be up-to-date)
   - Build the docs using Sphinx and the open "index.html" (Guaranteed to be up-to-date)
