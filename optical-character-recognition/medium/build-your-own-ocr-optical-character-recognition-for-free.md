# [Build your own OCR(Optical Character Recognition) for free][source]

**Optical Character Recognition**, or OCR is a technology that enables you to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images captured by a digital camera into editable and searchable data. It converts these documents into machine coded text.

OCR has been gaining recent popularity and being able to identify what is present in the image opens up a new horizon of opportunities.

For the past few years OCR frameworks has evolved a lot but not to an extent where they could be 100% for any image size or any image quality.

In order to get it more closer to 100%, requires a lot of tuning and training. There is a lot of pre-processing work involved before the most accurate information could be retrieved.

There are many softwares/APIs available out there which could be do a pretty good job of processing an image and based on what they could do and how well they do the prices vary.

Let us go over some of these in detail.

## Some popular OCR APIs

- [**Google vision api**][1] is one of the most popular API’s available and it gets you the most accurate information. Vision API is more of an image processing framework than just an optical character recognition framework. If the intention is to just identify what characters are present in the image, this framework has a lot more to it. This framework is really expensive unless your base set of images are a few. Below is the [pricing information][2].

- [**Amazon Rekognition**][3] is again an image processing framework just like the Google’s Vision API.This framework uses deep learning technology to identify objects, image and faces. This is little less expensive than Vision API. Below is the [pricing information][4].

- [**OCR Space**][5] is a more of a budget friendly option compared to the first 2 options. This SDK does a neat job of getting the needed information but not to the level of Rekognition and Vision APIs. If your requirement is less than 25K request a month you can even get away for free. Below is the [pricing information][6].
