Flattening images of curled pages, as an optimization problem.

## Overview

A while back, I wrote a script to create PDFs from photos of hand-written text. It was nothing special – just [adaptive thresholding][01] and combining multiple images into a PDF – but it came in handy whenever a student emailed me their homework as a pile of JPEGs. After I demoed the program to my fiancée, she ended up asking me to run it from time to time on photos of archival documents for her linguistics research. This summer, she came back from the library with a number of images where the text was significantly warped due to curled pages.
