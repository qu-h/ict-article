Training Custom Object Detector
===============================

So, up to now you should have done the following:

- Installed TensorFlow, either CPU or GPU (See :ref:`tf_install`)
- Installed TensorFlow Models (See :ref:`tf_models_install`)
- Installed labelImg (See :ref:`labelImg_install`)

Now that we have done all the above, we can start doing some cool stuff. Here we will see how you can train your own object detector, and since it is not as simple as it sounds, we will have a look at:

1. How to organise your workspace/training files
2. How to prepare/annotate image datasets
3. How to generate tf records from such datasets
4. How to configure a simple training pipeline 
5. How to train a model and monitor it's progress
6. How to export the resulting model and use it to detect objects.

Preparing workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If you have followed the tutorial, you should by now have a folder ``Tensorflow``, placed under ``<PATH_TO_TF>`` (e.g. ``C:\Users\sglvladi\Documents``), with the following directory tree:

    .. code-block:: bash

        TensorFlow
        ├─ addons
        │   └── labelImg
        └─ models
            ├── official
            ├── research
            ├── samples
            └── tutorials

2. Now create a new folder under ``TensorFlow``  and call it ``workspace``. It is within the ``workspace`` that we will store all our training set-ups. Now let's go under workspace and create another folder named ``training_demo``. Now our directory structure should be as so:

    .. code-block:: bash

        TensorFlow
        ├─ addons
        │   └─ labelImg
        ├─ models
        │   ├─ official
        │   ├─ research
        │   ├─ samples
        │   └─ tutorials
        └─ workspace
            └─ training_demo

3. The ``training_demo`` folder shall be our `training folder`, which will contain all files related to our model training. It is advisable to create a separate training folder each time we wish to train a different model. The typical structure for training folders is shown below.

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        training_demo
        ├─ annotations
        ├─ images
        │   ├─ test
        │   └─ train
        ├─ pre-trained-model
        ├─ training
        └─ README.md

Here's an explanation for each of the folders/filer shown in the above tree:

- ``annotations``: This folder will be used to store all ``*.csv`` files and the respective TensorFlow ``*.record`` files, which contain the list of annotations for our dataset images. 
- ``images``: This folder contains a copy of all the images in our dataset, as well as the respective ``*.xml`` files produced for each one, once ``labelImg`` is used to annotate objects.

    * ``images\train``: This folder contains a copy of all images, and the respective ``*.xml`` files, which will be used to train our model.
    * ``images\test``: This folder contains a copy of all images, and the respective ``*.xml`` files, which will be used to test our model.

- ``pre-trained-model``: This folder will contain the pre-trained model of our choice, which shall be used as a starting checkpoint for our training job.
- ``training``: This folder will contain the training pipeline configuration file ``*.config``, as well as a ``*.pbtxt`` label map file and all files generated during the training of our model.
- ``README.md``: This is an optional file which provides some general information regarding the training conditions of our model. It is not used by TensorFlow in any way, but it generally helps when you have a few training folders and/or you are revisiting a trained model after some time.

If you do not understand most of the things mentioned above, no need to worry, as we'll see how all the files are generated further down.

Annotating images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To annotate images we will be using the `labelImg <https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg>`_ package. If you haven't installed the package yet, then have a look at :ref:`labelImg_install`. 

- Once you have collected all the images to be used to test your model (ideally more than 100 per class), place them inside the folder ``training_demo\images``. 
- Open a new `Anaconda/Command Prompt` window and ``cd`` into ``Tensorflow\addons\labelImg``.
- If (as suggested in :ref:`labelImg_install`) you created a separate Conda environment for ``labelImg`` then go ahead and activate it by running:

    .. code-block:: posh

        activate labelImg

- Next go ahead and start ``labelImg``, pointing it to your ``training_demo\images`` folder.

    .. code-block:: posh

        python labelImg.py ..\..\workspace\training_demo\images

- A File Explorer Dialog windows should open, which points to the ``training_demo\images`` folder.
- Press the "Select Folder" button, to start annotating your images.

Once open, you should see a window similar to the one below:

.. image:: ./_static/labelImg.JPG
   :width: 90%
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center

I won't be covering a tutorial on how to use ``labelImg``, but you can have a look at `labelImg's repo <https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg#usage>`_ for more details. A nice Youtube video demonstrating how to use ``labelImg`` is also available `here <https://youtu.be/K_mFnvzyLvc?t=9m13s>`_. What is important is that once you annotate all your images, a set of new ``*.xml`` files, one for each image, should be generated inside your ``training_demo\images`` folder. 

Once you have finished annotating your image dataset, it is a general convention to use only part of it for training, and the rest is used for testing purposes. Typically, the ratio is 90%/10%, i.e. 90% of the images are used for training and the rest 10% is maintained for testing, but you can chose whatever ratio suits your needs. 

Once you have decided how you will be splitting your dataset, copy all training images, together with their corresponding ``*.xml`` files, and place them inside the ``training_demo\images\train`` folder. Similarly, copy all testing images, with their ``*.xml`` files, and paste them inside ``training_demo\images\train``.

Creating Label Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TensorFlow requires a label map, which namely maps each of the used labels to an integer values. This label map is used both by the training and detection processes.

Below I show an example label map (e.g ``label_map.pbtxt``), assuming that our dataset containes 2 labels, ``dogs`` and ``cats``:

.. code-block:: json

    item {
        id: 1
        name: 'cat'
    }

    item {
        id: 2
        name: 'dog'
    }

Label map files have the extention ``.pbtxt`` and should be placed inside the ``training_demo\annotations`` folder.

Creating TensorFlow Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have generated our annotations and split our dataset into the desired training and testing subsets, it is time to convert our annotations into the so called ``TFRecord`` format.

There are two steps in doing so:

- Converting the individual ``*.xml`` files to a unified ``*.csv`` file for each dataset.
- Converting the ``*.csv`` files of each dataset to ``*.record`` files (TFRecord format).

Before we proceed to describe the above steps, let's create a directory where we can store some scripts. Under the ``TensorFlow`` folder, create a new folder ``TensorFlow\scripts``, which we can use to store some useful scripts. To make things even tidier, let's create a new folder ``TensorFlow\scripts\preprocessing``, where we shall store scripts that we can use to preprocess our training inputs. Below is out ``TensorFlow`` directory tree structure, up to now:

.. code-block:: bash

    TensorFlow
    ├─ addons
    │   └─ labelImg
    ├─ models
    │   ├─ official
    │   ├─ research
    │   ├─ samples
    │   └─ tutorials
    ├─ scripts
    │   └─ preprocessing
    └─ workspace
        └─ training_demo

Converting ``*.xml`` to ``*.csv``
---------------------------------

To do this we can write a simple script that iterates through all ``*.xml`` files in the ``training_demo\images\train`` and ``training_demo\images\test`` folders, and generates a ``*.csv`` for each of the two.

Here is an example script that allows us to do just that:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    Usage:
    # Create train data:
    python xml_to_csv.py -i [PATH_TO_IMAGES_FOLDER]/train -o [PATH_TO_ANNOTATIONS_FOLDER]/train_labels.csv  

    # Create test data:
    python xml_to_csv.py -i [PATH_TO_IMAGES_FOLDER]/test -o [PATH_TO_ANNOTATIONS_FOLDER]/test_labels.csv

    def xml_to_csv(path):

            The path containing the .xml files

        xml_list = []
        for xml_file in glob.glob(path + '/*.xml'):
            tree = ET.parse(xml_file)
            root = tree.getroot()
            for member in root.findall('object'):
                value = (root.find('filename').text,
                        int(root.find('size')[0].text),
                        int(root.find('size')[1].text),

        column_name = ['filename', 'width', 'height',
                    'class', 'xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax']
        xml_df = pd.DataFrame(xml_list, columns=column_name)
        return xml_df


    def main():
        # Initiate argument parser
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
            description="Sample TensorFlow XML-to-CSV converter")
        parser.add_argument("-i",
                            "--inputDir",

        assert(os.path.isdir(args.inputDir))

        xml_df = xml_to_csv(args.inputDir)
        xml_df.to_csv(
            args.outputFile, index=None)
        print('Successfully converted xml to csv.')


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()


- Create a new file with name ``xml_to_csv.py`` under ``TensorFlow\scripts\preprocessing``, open it, paste the above code inside it and save.
- Install the ``pandas`` package:

    .. code-block:: posh

        conda install pandas # Anaconda
                             # or
        pip install pandas   # pip

- Finally, ``cd`` into ``TensorFlow\scripts\preprocessing`` and run:

    .. code-block:: posh
        
        # Create train data:
        python xml_to_csv.py -i [PATH_TO_IMAGES_FOLDER]/train -o [PATH_TO_ANNOTATIONS_FOLDER]/train_labels.csv  

        # Create test data:
        python xml_to_csv.py -i [PATH_TO_IMAGES_FOLDER]/test -o [PATH_TO_ANNOTATIONS_FOLDER]/test_labels.csv 

        # For example
        # python xml_to_csv.py -i C:\Users\sglvladi\Documents\TensorFlow\workspace\training_demo\images\train -o C:\Users\sglvladi\Documents\TensorFlow\workspace\training_demo\annotations\train_labels.csv

Once the above is done, there should be 2 new files under the ``training_demo\annotations`` folder, named ``test_labels.csv`` and ``train_labels.csv``, respectively.

Converting from ``*.csv`` to ``*.record``
-----------------------------------------

Now that we have obtained our ``*.csv`` annotation files, we will need to convert them into TFRecords. Below is an example script that allows us to do just that:

Configuring a Training Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the purposes of this tutorial we will not be creating a training job from the scratch, but rather we will go through how to reuse one of the pre-trained models provided by TensorFlow. If you would like to train an entirely new model, you can have a look at `TensorFlow's tutorial <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/configuring_jobs.md>`_.

The model we shall be using in our examples is the ``ssd_inception_v2_coco`` model, since it provides a relatively good trade-off between performance and speed, however there are a number of other models you can use, all of which are listed in `TensorFlow's detection model zoo <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md>`_. More information about the detection performance, as well as reference times of execution, for each of the available pre-trained models can be found `here <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models-coco-models>`_.

First of all, we need to get ourselves the sample pipeline configuration file for the specific model we wish to re-train. You can find the specific file for the model of your choice `here <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/samples/configs>`_. In our case, since we shall be using the ``ssd_inception_v2_coco`` model, we shall be downloading the corresponding `ssd_inception_v2_coco.config <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/samples/configs/ssd_inception_v2_coco.config>`_ file. 

Apart from the configuration file, we also need to download the latest pre-trained NN for the model we wish to use. This can be done by simply clicking on the name of the desired model in the tables found in `TensorFlow's detection model zoo <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models-coco-models>`_. Clicking on the name of your model should initiate a download for a ``*.tar.gz`` file. 

Once the ``*.tar.gz`` file has been downloaded, open it using a decompression program of your choice (e.g. 7zip, WinZIP, etc.). Next, open the folder that you see when the compressed folder is opened (typically it will have the same name as the compressed folded, without the ``*.tar.gz`` extension), and extract it's contents inside the folder ``training_demo\pre-trained-model``.

Now that we have downloaded and extracted our pre-trained model, let's have a look at the changes that we shall need to apply to the downloaded  ``*.config`` file (highlighted in yellow):

.. code-block:: python

    # well as the label_map_path and input_path fields in the train_input_reader and
    # eval_input_reader. Search for "PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED" to find the fields that
    # should be configured.

Once the above changes have been applied to our config file, go ahead and save it under ``training_demo/training``.

Training the Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before we begin training our model, let's go and copy the ``TensorFlow/models/research/object_detection/legacy/train.py`` script and paste it straight into our ``training_demo`` folder. We will need this script in order to train our model.

Now, to initiate a new training job, ``cd`` inside the ``training_demo`` folder and type the following: 

.. code-block:: posh 

    python train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssd_inception_v2_coco.config

Once the training process has been initiated, you should see a series of print outs similar to the one below (plus/minus some warnings):

.. code-block:: python

    ...

If you ARE NOT seeing a print-out similar to that shown above, and/or the training job crashes after a few seconds, then have a look at the issues and proposed solutions, under the :ref:`issues` section, to see if you can find a solution. Alternatively, you can try the issues section of the official `Tensorflow Models repo <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues>`_. 

If you ARE observing a similar output to the above, then CONGRATULATIONS, you have successfully started your first training job. Now you may very well treat yourself to a cold beer, as waiting on the training to finish is likely to take a while. Following what people have said online, it seems that it is advisable to allow you model to reach a ``TotalLoss`` of at least 2 (ideally 1 and lower) if you want to achieve "fair" detection results. Obviously, lower ``TotalLoss`` is better, however very low ``TotalLoss`` should be avoided, as the model may end up overfitting the dataset, meaning that it will perform poorly when applied to images outside the dataset. To monitor ``TotalLoss``, as well as a number of other metrics, while your model is training, have a look at :ref:`tensorboard_sec`. 

Training times can be affected by a number of factors such as:
    - The computational power of you hardware (either CPU or GPU): Obviously, the more powerful your PC is, the faster the training process. 
    - Whether you are using the TensorFlow CPU or GPU variant: In general, even when compared to the best CPUs, almost any GPU graphics card will yield much faster training and detection speeds. As a matter of fact, when I first started I was running TensorFlow on my `Intel i7-5930k` (6/12 cores @ 4GHz, 32GB RAM) and was getting step times of around `12 sec/step`, after which I installed TensorFlow GPU and training the very same model -using the same dataset and config files- on a `EVGA GTX-770` (1536 CUDA-cores @ 1GHz, 2GB VRAM) I was down to `0.9 sec/step`!!! A 12-fold increase in speed, using a "low/mid-end" graphics card, when compared to a "mid/high-end" CPU. 
    - How big the dataset is: The higher the number of images in your dataset, the longer it will take for the model to reach satisfactory levels of detection performance.
    - The complexity of the objects you are trying to detect: Obviously, if your objective is to track a black ball over a white background, the model will converge to satisfactory levels of detection pretty quickly. If on the other hand, for example, you wish to detect ships in ports, using Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras, then training will be a much more challenging and time-consuming process, due to the high variability of the shape and size of ships, combined with a highly dynamic background.
    - And many, many, many, more.... 

.. _tensorboard_sec:

Monitor Training Job Progress using TensorBoard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very nice feature of TensorFlow, is that it allows you to coninuously monitor and visualise a number of different training/detection performance metrics, while your model is being trained. The specific tool that allows us to do all that is `Tensorboard <https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard>`_. 

To start a new TensorBoard server, we follow the following steps:

- Open a new `Anaconda/Command Prompt`
- Activate your TensorFlow conda environment (if you have one), e.g.:

    .. code-block:: posh

        activate tensorflow_gpu

- ``cd`` into the ``training_demo`` folder.
- Run the following command:

    .. code-block:: posh

        tensorboard --logdir=training\

The above command will start a new TensorBoard server, which (by default) listens to port 6006 of your machine. Assuming that everything went well, you should see a print-out similar to the one below (plus/minus some warnings):

    .. code-block:: posh

        TensorBoard 1.6.0 at http://YOUR-PC:6006 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Once this is done, go to your browser and type ``http://YOUR-PC:6006`` in your address bar, following which you should be presented with a dashboard similar to the one shown below (maybe less populated if your model has just started training):

.. image:: ./_static/TensorBoard.JPG
   :width: 90%
   :alt: alternate text
   :align: center



Exporting a Trained Inference Graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your training job is complete, you need to extract the newly trained inference graph, which will be later used to perform the object detection. This can be done as follows:

- Open a new `Anaconda/Command Prompt`
- Activate your TensorFlow conda environment (if you have one), e.g.:

    .. code-block:: posh

        activate tensorflow_gpu

- Copy the ``TensorFlow/models/research/object_detection/export_inference_graph.py`` script and paste it straight into your ``training_demo`` folder.
- Check inside your ``training_demo/training`` folder for the ``model.ckpt-*`` checkpoint file with the highest number following the name of the dash e.g. ``model.ckpt-34350``). This number represents the training step index at which the file was created.
- Alternatively, simply sort all the files inside ``training_demo/training`` by descending time and pick the ``model.ckpt-*`` file that comes first in the list.
- Make a note of the file's name, as it will be passed as an argument when we call the ``export_inference_graph.py`` script.
- Now, ``cd`` inside your ``training_demo`` folder, and run the following command:

.. code-block:: posh
    
    python export_inference_graph.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path training/ssd_inception_v2_coco.config --trained_checkpoint_prefix training/model.ckpt-13302 --output_directory trained-inference-graphs/output_inference_graph_v1.pb
