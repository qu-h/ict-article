# Regex tutorial â€” A quick cheatsheet by examples

UPDATE! Check out my new REGEX COOKBOOK about the most commonly used (and most wanted) regex ðŸŽ‰

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in **extracting information from any text** by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).

Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping.

One of the most interesting features is that once youâ€™ve learned the syntax, you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages â€‹â€‹(JavaScript, Java, VB, C #, C / C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Delphi, R, Tcl, and many others) with the slightest distinctions about the support of the most advanced features and syntax versions supported by the engines).

Letâ€™s start by looking at some examples and explanations.

## Basic topics

### Anchors â€” ^ and $

|||
|---|---|
|^The|matches any string that starts with The -> Try it!
|end$ | matches a string that ends with end
|^The end$ | exact string match (starts and ends with The |end)
|roar|matches any string that has the text roar in it


### Quantifiers â€” * + ? and {}

|||
|---|---|
|abc* | matches a string that has `ab followed by zero or more c` -> [Try it!][01]
|abc+ | matches a string that has `ab followed by one or more c`
|abc? | matches a string that has `ab followed by zero or one c`
|abc{2} | matches a string that has `ab followed by 2 c`
|abc{2,} | matches a string that has `ab followed by 2 or more c`
|abc{2,5} | matches a string that has `ab followed by 2 up to 5 c`
|a(bc)* | matches a string that has `a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc`
|a(bc){2,5} | matches a string that has `a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc`
