# [Detecting custom objects in images/video using YOLO with Darkflow][source]

> This is another story of an ongoing series about object detection using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, the first one is an introduction about the algorithm and a brief exploration of (some of) the different implementations: https://medium.com/@monocasero/object-detection-with-yolo-implementations-and-how-to-use-them-5da928356035

## Introduction

The different YOLO implementations (Darknet, Darkflow, etc) are amazing tools that can be used to start detecting common objects in images or videos “out of the box”, to do that detection it is only necessary to download and install the system and already trained weights. For instance, in the official Darknet website we can find the steps to obtain and use the weights trained for COCO dataset or VOC PASCAL.
